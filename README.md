**Abstract**
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, and often, unique strengths and differences. It isn't a "behavioral disease" in the traditional sense but rather a neurological condition affecting how individuals perceive and socialize with the world around them. ASD isn't something that can be "cured," but interventions and support can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD, aiding in managing symptoms and fostering better social integration. In recent years, technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning, have shown promise in aiding the early detection and analysis of ASD. One such approach involves leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, to predict and analyze ASD based on facial images. These CNN models, VGG16 and VGG19, have been employed in this context, using a dataset containing images of both autistic and non-autistic children. The VGG16 and VGG19 models are known for their deep architecture, utilizing multiple layers of convolutions and pooling to extract intricate features from images. In the context of ASD prediction, these models have demonstrated notable accuracies of approximately 86.333% and 86.0%, respectively. The utilization of CNNs in ASD prediction signifies an innovative step forward in leveraging technology for early detection and support, albeit with the need for ongoing improvements and ethical considerations to ensure responsible and effective implementation in clinical settings.
